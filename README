Lab Assignment 6: README for TinySearchEngine
08/16/2015

##########################################################################################

This is the README for the entire TinySearchEngine. For specific instruction, refer to the 
README for crawler, indexer and query.

Instructions for use: 

1) Run make tse in the top directory to make crawler, indexer and query for the TinySearchEngine.
   make tse will also make the library by calling make lib in the util directory.
   Run make clean to clean up the files created during compiling
   
2) To run crawler, change to the crawler directory and type in:
   ./crawler [SEED URL] [TARGET DIRECTORY WHERE TO PUT THE DATA] [MAX CRAWLING DEPTH]
   eg: ./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./data 1
   
   More detailed instructions can be found in the README in the crawler directory
   
3) To run indexer, change to the indexer directory and use the following 2 input options:

 	 ./indexer [TARGET_DIRECTORY] [RESULTS FILE NAME] (1)
     ./indexer [TARGET_DIRECTORY] [RESULTS FILENAME] [REWRITEN FILENAME] (2)
     
  (1) is the regular option used to create an inverted index [RESULTS FILE NAME]
  (2) is the testing option used to test the reconstruction of an inverted index from the 
  		file [RESULTS FILE NAME]
  
  Both options extract files from [TARGET_DIRECTORY]
  
  [RESULTS FILE NAME] and [REWRITEN FILENAME] will then be saved in [TARGET_DIRECTORY]
   as indicated in the lab instructions
   
   More detailed instructions can be found in the README in the indexer directory

4) To run query, change to the query directory and use the following input option:

 	 ./query [INDEX FILE] [HTML DIR]
     
  [INDEX FILE] is the file name of the inverted index and [HTML DIR] is the directory that
  stores all the html files
   
5) To test crawler, indexer and query, go to the respective directory and use the testing 
   shell script

6) util is the directory that contains the common file used to build the static library
